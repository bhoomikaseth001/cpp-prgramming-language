maximum array size
#inside main
int--->arr[10^6] bool--->10*7
#globally
int--->arr[10^7] bool--->10^8

--------------------------------------------

time complexity
1)map
 best average worst sabki O(log N) 
where N is the number of elements in map

in map you can use key in form of any data structre

2)unordered map
 average and best is O(1)
 worst is O(N)
where N is the number of elements in map
worst case is very rarely happen , so use unordered map
if it fails, and give TLE , then jump into map

this worst case happen bcz of internal collisions

in unordered map it is you cannot use many data structre as key
it is limited
